## 📌 Project Overview

**Yachts_devscout** is a yacht management and marketplace platform supporting five user roles:

- **Yachts** – Subscribe to plans, create jobs for suppliers/crew/freelancers, purchase products from suppliers, message other users, manage yacht profiles, and view order history.
- **Suppliers** – Add products with pricing, apply for yacht jobs, manage subscriptions, view order history, and process payments via Stripe.
- **Crew** – Maintain a profile, apply for jobs, and communicate with other users.
- **Freelancers** – Maintain a profile, apply for jobs, and communicate with other users.
- **Super Admin** – Manage the platform, oversee all user accounts, handle subscriptions, and ensure operational integrity.

Each role features secure authentication, verification, and dedicated dashboards.
